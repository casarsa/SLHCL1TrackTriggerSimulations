SLHCL1TrackTriggerSimulations
=============================

Originally from https://github.com/sviret/HL_LHC, split into its own repository

Added Configuration, NTupleTools, AMSimulation subpackages and the workflow is integrated more tightly to the official CMSSW framework.

- Configuration: for generating particle gun samples
- NTupleTools: for flattening EDM ROOT files
- AMSimulation: for simulation of associative-memory-based track finding
